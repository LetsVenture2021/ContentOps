Calculate your net operating income and divide by your annual debt payment. If it's above 1.25, you're usually good. Closed in 21 days vs 45+ for conventional."

Everyone's chasing Austin, but Houston has better fundamentals - lower vacancy (5.8% vs 7.2%), stronger job growth, and cap rates are 50-75 bps higher. Just closed a 150-unit deal in Pearland at 5.8% cap. Would've been 5.0% in Austin."
